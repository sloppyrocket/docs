              <p>Platform Forus facilitates trusted interaction between supply and demand by openly providing smart contracts, API's and corresponding documentation.
                Users will not depend on trusted third parties to provide security to the agreements which make their interaction possible.
                The first application built on Platform Forus named "Kindpakket" has been implemented in the municipality of Zuidhorn.
                The Platform is currently under development and can be followed on our Github page.
