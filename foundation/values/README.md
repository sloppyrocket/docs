# Values

_Wiki's such as these are living documents. If you want to improve anything; feel free to make an issue and bring it to the attention of the team in both the real and digital world. Our policy on making issues and altering wiki's you can find here._

Important and lasting beliefs or ideals shared by the members of a culture about what is good or bad and desirable or undesirable. 

1. Always aim for the highest possible good.

There is always a chance to do just a proper job, but ask yourself if it contributes to a bigger game.

2. Be open, honest and transparant.

No fake news!

3. Build the organisation you want to be a part of.

If you see something you do not like, think of a way to improve it and act on it. 
If it felt easy to do then there is space to improve or improvise.

4. Value your and othersÂ´ time.

5. Don't compare yourself to others. 

Compare yourself to who you were yesterday.

6. Get to know each other and each others work.

Then you can offer help or collaborate.
